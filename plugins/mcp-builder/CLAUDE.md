# MCP Builder Plugin

Comprehensive guidance for creating high-quality Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

## Use When

- Building MCP servers to integrate external APIs or services
- Working with Python (FastMCP) or Node/TypeScript (MCP SDK)
- Designing tools for AI agents to interact with external services

## Key Features

- Agent-centric design principles
- Workflow-focused tool design (not just API wrappers)
- Response optimization for limited context
- Evaluation-driven development approach
- Language-specific implementation guides

## Workflow

1. **Research and planning** - MCP protocol, API documentation, tool selection
2. **Implementation** - Project structure, shared utilities, tool development
3. **Review and refine** - Code quality, testing, validation
4. **Create evaluations** - 10 complex questions to test LLM effectiveness

## Design Principles

- Design tools for agent workflows, not just API endpoints
- Optimize responses for limited context windows
- Provide actionable, structured data
- Think about the agent's decision-making process
- Test with real LLM interactions to validate effectiveness
