## Context

Read the following documents:

- [spec-templates/SPEC_PATTERNS.md](../spec-templates/SPEC_PATTERNS.md)
- [spec-templates/SPEC_TEMPLATE.md](../spec-templates/SPEC_TEMPLATE.md)
- [spec-templates/TECH_SPEC_TEMPLATE.md](../spec-templates/TECH_SPEC_TEMPLATE.md)
- [spec-templates/COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md](../spec-templates/COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md)

Then read the following claude code slash commands that are used to create these:

- [commands/prime-spec.md](prime-spec.md)
- [commands/prime-tech.md](prime-tech.md)
- [commands/prime-build.md](prime-build.md)

Finally reference the latest spec at specs/ that was implemented as an example of a real life case
